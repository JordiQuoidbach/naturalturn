Description: R implementation of the NaturalTurn algorithm for analyzing conversational transcripts. This package implements the NaturalTurn method by Cooney & Reece (2025) to identify primary turns and overlapping speech (backchannels/secondary turns), collapsing short pauses within the same speaker while preserving overlaps. It also implements interruption detection and within-speech pause tracking algorithms from Di Stasi et al. (2024). Outputs data in wide format with one row per primary turn and listener overlaps in columns. This is an R port of the Python companion repository at https://github.com/betterup/natural-turn-transcription.
