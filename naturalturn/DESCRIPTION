Description: R implementation of the NaturalTurn algorithm (Cooney & Reece, 2025) for segmenting conversational transcripts into psychologically meaningful turns. The package identifies primary turns and overlapping speech (backchannels/secondary), collapsing short pauses within the same speaker while preserving overlaps. Additionally, it integrates interruption detection and within-speech pause tracking algorithms from Di Stasi, Templeton, & Quoidbach (2024). Outputs data in wide format with one row per primary turn and listener overlaps in columns. This is an R port of the Python companion repository at <https://github.com/betterup/natural-turn-transcription>.
