\title{Classify Turns with Overlaps}
\usage{
classify_turns_with_overlaps(
  df,
  backchannel_word_max = 3,
  backchannel_second_max = 0,
  backchannel_proportion = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame with collapsed turns (from
\code{\link{collapse_turns_preserving_overlaps}}).}

\item{backchannel_word_max}{Maximum word count for backchannel classification.
Default: 3.}

\item{backchannel_second_max}{Maximum duration for backchannel classification.
Default: 0.0.}

\item{backchannel_proportion}{Minimum proportion of words that must be
backchannel cues. Default: 0.5.}
}
\value{
Data frame with added columns:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{is_primary}: Logical, whether turn is primary
    \item \code{utterance_type}: Character, "primary", "backchannel", or "secondary"
  }
}
\description{
Classifies each turn as primary or secondary/backchannel. A turn is
secondary if it is completely contained within another turn (different
speaker, starts after and ends before/at the same time as the containing turn).
}
\details{
Secondary turns are those that overlap completely within a primary
  turn from a different speaker. The function then uses
  \code{\link{determine_utterance_type}} to further classify secondary turns
  as backchannels or secondary turns.
