\title{Pivot to Wide Format}
\usage{
pivot_to_wide_format(
  df,
  interruption_duration_min = 6,
  interruption_lag_duration_min = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame with assigned turn IDs (from
\code{\link{assign_wide_turn_ids}}).}

\item{interruption_duration_min}{Minimum duration (seconds) for a turn to be
considered an interruption. Default: 6.0.}

\item{interruption_lag_duration_min}{Minimum duration (seconds) of the
previous turn for current turn to be an interruption. Default: 1.0.}
}
\value{
Data frame in wide format with one row per primary turn. Columns include:
  \itemize{
    \item Primary speaker columns: \code{speaker}, \code{start}, \code{stop},
      \code{duration}, \code{utterance}, \code{responseTime}, \code{interruption},
      \code{n_words_speaker}, etc.
    \item Listener overlap columns: \code{n_listener_turns}, \code{overlap_speaker},
      \code{utterance_listener} (concatenated), and \code{*_listener_list} columns
      (lists of individual listener turns)
  }
}
\description{
Converts the long-format turn data to wide format, with one row per primary
turn and listener overlaps (backchannels/secondary turns) stored in columns.
}
\details{
Interruption detection follows criteria from Di Stasi et al. (2024),
  based on Farley (2008): a turn is flagged as an interruption if all of the
  following are true:
  \itemize{
    \item Current turn duration > \code{interruption_duration_min}
    \item Current turn starts before previous turn ends (pause < 0, overlap)
    \item Previous turn duration > \code{interruption_lag_duration_min}
    \item Current speaker is different from previous speaker
  }
