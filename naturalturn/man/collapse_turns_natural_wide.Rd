\title{Collapse Turns into Natural Turn Wide Format}
\usage{
collapse_turns_natural_wide(
  transcript_df,
  max_pause = 1.5,
  backchannel_word_max = 3,
  backchannel_proportion = 0.5,
  interruption_duration_min = 6,
  interruption_lag_duration_min = 1,
  speaker_col = "speaker",
  text_col = "text",
  start_col = "time.s",
  stop_col = "time.e"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{transcript_df}{Data frame with transcript data. Must contain columns
for speaker, text, start time, and stop time.}

\item{max_pause}{Maximum pause (seconds) between consecutive segments from
the same speaker to be merged into one turn. Default: 1.5.}

\item{backchannel_word_max}{Maximum word count for backchannel classification.
Default: 3.}

\item{backchannel_proportion}{Minimum proportion of words that must be
backchannel cues. Default: 0.5 (50%).}

\item{interruption_duration_min}{Minimum duration (seconds) for a turn to be
considered an interruption. Default: 6.0.}

\item{interruption_lag_duration_min}{Minimum duration (seconds) of the
previous turn for current turn to be an interruption. Default: 1.0.}

\item{speaker_col}{Name of column containing speaker identifier. Default: "speaker".}

\item{text_col}{Name of column containing utterance text. Default: "text".}

\item{start_col}{Name of column containing start time in seconds. Default: "time.s".}

\item{stop_col}{Name of column containing stop time in seconds. Default: "time.e".}
}
\value{
Data frame in wide format with one row per primary turn. See
  \code{\link{pivot_to_wide_format}} for column descriptions.
}
\description{
Main function implementing the NaturalTurn algorithm. Collapses short pauses
within the same speaker, classifies turns as primary/secondary/backchannel,
and outputs data in wide format with one row per primary turn and listener
overlaps in columns.
}
\details{
This function implements the NaturalTurn algorithm by Cooney &
  Reece (2025). The algorithm:
  \itemize{
    \item Collapses short pauses (< \code{max_pause}) within the same speaker
    \item Classifies turns as primary (main speaker) or secondary/backchannel
      (overlapping speech)
    \item Joins consecutive primary turns from the same speaker
    \item Assigns turn IDs, grouping secondary turns with their primary
    \item Pivots to wide format with listener overlaps in columns
  }

  Interruption detection and within-speech pause tracking are implemented
  based on Di Stasi et al. (2024).

\dontrun{
# Example transcript data

  time.s = c(0.0, 1.2, 1.5, 3.0, 3.5),
  time.e = c(1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 4.2)
